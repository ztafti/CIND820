# Predictive factors for depression, anxiety and stress using the depression, anxiety, stress scale (DASS) 

This repository includes the data, codes and documents for the "Predictive factors for depression, anxiety and stress using the depression, anxiety, stress scale (DASS) " Project for CIND820. 

**The stages of the project are:**

1. The data is obtained from Kaggle "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yamqwe/depression-anxiety-stress-scales/download" 
2. For data cleaning I conducted some calculation based on the instructions for final score of each participent, using the DASS and TIPI guidelines, there was no null values or further clean-up necessary for this dataset
3. For EDA I used some simple descriptive statistics as well as histograms, boxplots and correlation matrix.
4. I used decission tree, naive bayes and random forest as the classification methods for my dataset.


**This repository includes the following branches:**

1. Data: There is the raw dataset, as well as a sample of the questionnaire and a picture of what questions looked like on the screen in this branch.
2. Code: There are (.ipynb) files available in this branch. 
  a. Data Preparation
  b. EDA
  c. Decission Tree Model
  *I Split the codes in 3 parts but EDA and Model might not run as the preparation part is removed from them*
3. Technical Reports: The (.pdf) files of the code I ran are available in this branch.
